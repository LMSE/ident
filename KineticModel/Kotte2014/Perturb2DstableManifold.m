% perturbation of points on the 2D manifold surface
function [] = Perturb2DstableManifold(2Dmanpts,saddle,model,pvec,npts)
% 2Dmanpts - points on the 2D manifold represented as triangles from
% delaunay triangulation

% choose points in random that are away from each other

% simulate from said points in forward time 

% check of final ss is the saddle node
