%PTS genes+proteins
ptsG %produces enzyme EIICB
ptsHI %operon produces enzyme EI, HPr, EIIA (minimal induction due to regulation)
%above operon/gene regulated by Mlc and CRP.cAMP and EIICB (through inducer exclusion)

%PTS flux
Vpts %kinetic rate laws for PTS using enzyme & metabolite concentrations
